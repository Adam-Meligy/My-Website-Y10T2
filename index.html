<!-- The <html> tag encompasses all the other html tags. all the website's code exists inside the <html> tags -->
<html>

<!-- anything in <head> doesn't appear on the website itself. here, data on different file relationships and what appears in the browser tab can be established -->

<head>
    <!-- links this html document to the CSS document specified in the href, and then states the relationship, in this case stylesheet. this allows the webpage to be changed and styled (as well as other things) in the CSS stylesheet -->
    <link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <!-- States the webpages title. this will appear in the browser tab when viewing the webpage -->
    <Title>Hollow Knight Dream Boss Index</Title>
</head>

<!-- this is where the main code of the website exists. the code in the body will determine what appears on the webpage itself -->

<body>
    <!-- adds an image. the src link is the image itself, alt is the alternate text that will appear if the image cannot be loaded, and class gives it a reference that can be used in the stylesheet to edit html tags with the same class -->
    <img src="Hollow_Knight_Logo.webp" alt="HOLLOW KNIGHT" class="Hollow_Knight_Logo">
    <!-- the <h#> (# is a number) tag the heading of the page. since this is the first, main and biggest heading of the page, the tag is <h1> -->
    <h1>DREAM BOSS INDEX</h1>

    <!-- div element groups code together, and the class allows to have multiple div elements that can be edited differently in the CSS stylesheet. the div element acts like a container for the code inside -->
    <div class="searchContainer">
        <!-- the input tag creates a input field where the user can input data. 
            the type specifies the data type, in this case text, meaning the user inputs text. 
            the id gives that specific line of code an id that is referenced in the javascript document (for the search function) and in the CSS stylesheet to style it. id is different than class. id is for a specific element, a specific line of code. it is used for styling individual elements. classes however can be applied to multiple elements and changes in CSS will apply to all the tags with the same class. .
            the "onkeyup" specifies means then when a key on the keyboard goes up (is released) then the following will happen. the following in this case is the search function. so every time a key is released while typing in the input field, the javascript function will happen
            the placeholder is the text that will appear in the input field when the user has not typed anything-->
        <input type="search" id="searchinput" onkeyup="searchFunction()" placeholder="Browse Bosses...">

            <!-- each <li> is a list item. they are what is inside the list. each list item will start on its own line and begin with a bullet point or number, depending on the list tag and the stylesheet -->
            <!-- the <a> tag is for an anchor link. 
                the href specifies the link itself. this link could be a web link or a link to a webpage. when clicked, if it is a webpage, it will navigate to that webpage on the website. if it is a web link, it will redirect the user to that web link.
                the text between the open and closing <a> tage is the placeholder text. this is the text that will appear on the website. the text can be clicked as a link, and will navigate the user to the link mentioned in the href -->
