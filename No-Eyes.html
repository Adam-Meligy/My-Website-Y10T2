        <p>No Eyes was a strong warrior who desperately wanted to rid the infection and tried many things to avoid
            being infected. She didn't and couldn't sleep knowing that if she dreams The Radiance would use her Light to
            infect her mind. She eventually became so crazy about protecting others and herself from the infection that
            she ripped out her own eyes and the eyes of other bugs so that they "couldn't see the Light", hence why she
            was called No Eyes. She and the other bugs still eventually succumbed to the infection. No Eyes' body was
            placed
            in the Stone Sanctuary, which was a place in complete darkness, which the bugs believed would help her avoid
            the
            Light even after her death. After being defeated, No Eyes starts talking to someone or something the Knight
            doesn't know and can't see, apologising for being frightened of them and starts praising them, and begs them
            to take "us" to a place where the Light cannot touch them, a place without dreams.</p>

                bobbing up and down, and disappear once they reach the edges of the arena, which No Eyes will then
                summon back. This is her main and only attack, but is used continuously, however there is a delay when
                she summons the ghosts of 2.25 seconds. At 150 health, the summoning delay decreases to 1.75 seconds,
                and to
                1.25 at 90 health. Deals 1 mask of damage.</li>
