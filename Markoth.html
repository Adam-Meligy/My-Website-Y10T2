        <p>Markoth was one of only 2 Moth Tribe members known to carry a weapon. Though most moths were passive, Markoth
            was a fierce warrior who was able to use dream magic, a trait common in the Moth Tribe, most likely due to
            their connection with The Radiance and being born from her Light. He traveled to the edges of the Kingdom of
            Hallownest to seclude himself from others to meditate, trying to "uncover a truth long forgotten." Anyone
            who entered Markoth's secluded area would be slain by him if he believed they would threaten him,
            regardless of their reasons. Over time, he died, alone in his cave, his remains not visible. After being
            defeated by the Knight, he reminisces about how he has never been beat in battle before. He says that
            warriors, knights, kings and even time itself have no power over him, only the Knight, who is the darkness,
            come to consume him.</p>

            <li>Dreamshield: Markoth summons a dreamshield that continuously orbits around him. The shield blocks the
                Knights attacks and deals 1 mask of damage if it touches the Knight. Once half his health is gone,
                Markoth summons another shield directly opposite the previous one.</li>
            <li>Nail Summon: Markoth summons a Nail, aiming it at the Knight's current location then firing towards it,
                dealing 1 mask of damage. This is his main attack and he uses it once every 1-2 seconds. At half health,
                the cooldown for his attack decreases to every 0.75-1.25 seconds.</li>
            <li>Shield Cyclone: Markoth will increasingly extend the range of his dreamshield and make it orbit much
                faster, dealing 1 mask of damage if it hits the Knight. However, he moves much slower during this
                attack.</li>
