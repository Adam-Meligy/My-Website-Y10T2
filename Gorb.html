        <p>Gorb was a mystic creature with an enlarged brain, titled “Gorb, The Great Mind” by his followers, and
            claimed to be All-Knowing. He goaded other bugs into following him, revering his mind, and convince them to
            “ascend” to a higher plane of existence. His body as well as the bodies of his followers were places atop a
            hill in the Howling Peaks, with a tombstone depicting Gorb's image.</p>

                damage. This is
